# Weather App

This is a weather forecast application built using React.js and Bootstrap. It uses two different APIs to access current weather and forecast information, and one geolocation API to get coordinates of any city.

You can add and remove different cities to your persistent favorite list, to keep track of their current temperature in the future.

### Installation

After cloning the repository, run `yarn` to install neccesary dependencies. You can then run `yarn dev` to run the app locally.
